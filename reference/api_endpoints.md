## Venmo API v1
Very well documented [here](https://github.com/mmohades/Venmo).


## Venmo API v5
Some super smart college kids from MIT actually identified a number of vulnerabilities with Venmo and mapped out the v5 API. You can read their paper [here](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2014/files/13-benkraft-jmoldow-mannes-venmo.pdf). Leveraging their work, I was able to build the first version of venemy rather quickly. However, most of the v5 endpoints are no longer accessible. The [public](https://venmo.com/api/v5/public) API is still accessible and does not require authentication.
